# Country Explorer: The Board Game

Embark on a journey of discovery with Country Explorer, a captivating and educational board game. This game, perfect for both individual and group play, invites players to explore and learn about various countries in an interactive and enjoyable way.

## Game Overview

Country Explorer is a combination of board and card gameplay, requiring the following components:
- 72 Country Cards
- One 6-sided dice
- A world map board (optional)
- Player tokens, one for each participant

### Country Cards: A World in Your Hand

Each card in the set is a gateway to a new country, rich with facts and visuals. The front of the card displays two background images: the top one pinpoints the country's location on the globe, while the bottom one presents a detailed map of the country, highlighting neighboring nations, the capital, and key cities. These maps aid in identifying the landmarks shown on the card's reverse side. Key country details are overlayed on these images:
- Country Number (1 to 72)
- Capitals (with the administrative capital underlined)
- Languages (official languages underlined, multiple languages denoted with an asterisk `*`)
- Population (displayed in a simplified format, e.g., `36M`, `1.4B`, `57K`)
- Currency (main currency name and ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code)
- Landmarks (four landmark images with transparent layouts and black borders, each frame labeled with the landmark and nearest city)
- Food and Drinks (three typical items, each with a bold title followed by a description)

### The Board: A Miniature World

The game board features a world map, optionally bordered by the flags of the 72 featured countries, each flag numbered for easy reference.

## Game Setup

Shuffle the Country Cards and place them face-down (landmark side up). If using the board, place the card stack in its designated spot and distribute a token to each player.

## Gameplay Rules

Players take turns in this game, which encompasses six default question categories:
1. Capital
2. Population
3. Languages
4. Currency
5. Landmarks
6. Food and Drinks

### Standard Multiplayer Game with Board

Players begin by placing their token on the country shown on the top card. If the country is too small, place the token adjacent to it. The dice roll determines the question category. For 'Landmarks' and 'Food and Drinks,' additional dice rolls select a specific item to identify.

The next player verifies the answers, reading descriptions aloud when the category is 'Food and Drinks'. Correct answers earn the card, and the player can continue if the next country is land-accessible. Incorrect answers result in the card being placed in a separate 'lost country' stack.

The game concludes when the card stack is depleted. The player with the most cards wins.

### Difficulty Adjustments

Categories can be customized or replaced with a 'Flag' category, where players identify the flag corresponding to their country. Other modifications, such as selecting landmarks without dice, are also possible.

### Boardless Play

The game can be played without the board, relying on players' knowledge to determine land accessibility between countries.

### Solo Play

Solo play focuses on beating personal records. The 'Food and Drinks' category is replaced with the 'Flag' category. Players self-verify their answers, moving on to the next card independently.
